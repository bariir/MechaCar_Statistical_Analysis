## Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Miles Per Gallon)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
-	The variables or coefficients that provided most non-random amount of variance
to mpg are vehicle_length and ground_cleance. From the linear model, the r-square value is 0.71 which means that more than 70% of the variability of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this model.<br>

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
-	Since p-value of the linear regression analysis is 6.712e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our model is not zero. <br>

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
-	The model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes with some effectiveness. It has r-square of 0.712 and p-value of 6.712e-11. <br>
